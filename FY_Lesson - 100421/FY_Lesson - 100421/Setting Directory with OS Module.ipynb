    "At a basic level your directory is where your are \"sitting\" in your computer. If you go to your Desktop through Finder or File Explorer you are in your \"Desktop\" directory. Most likely you have subdirectories inside of your Desktop such as a folder for classes etc. When using Jupyter Notebook and most other IDEs (code editting programs) your code is going to have access just to your currenct directory. For example, lets download some financial data for the month of June 2021 in New Zealand. "
