    "At a basic level your directory is where your are \"sitting\" in your computer. If you go to your Desktop through Finder or File Explorer you are in your \"Desktop\" directory. Most likely you have subdirectories inside of your Desktop such as a folder for classes etc. When using Jupyter Notebook and most other IDEs (code editting programs) your code is going to have access just to your currenct directory. For example, lets download some financial data for the month of June 2021 in New Zealand. "

This means that you can access the files within this directory, and subsequent subdirectories. This allows you to easily share code and data with other members of your team assuming that you accessing Dropbox. Another function that is powerful is the division of work. In research it was always my job to divide up large manual input or coding assignments among the other research assistants and this allows you to generalize your code to every member of team because everyone will have generally the same path to get to Dropbox (and once in Dropbox you can be 100% sure that the path is the same).
